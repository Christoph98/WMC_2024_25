                <h3>How does the 30-day free trial work?</h3>
                <p>You can use Pulse absolutely free for 30 days. After 30 days, we will charge the credit card you used when you sign up. If you choose to cancel your account before your trial ends, your card will not be charged.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>If I upgrade an existing account, do I get another free trial?</h3>
                <p>Brand new accounts are the only ones eligible for a 30-day free trial. If you upgrade an existing account, your credit card will be billed the new amount on the date of your next billing cycle.</p>

                <h3>What is a “Financial Account”?</h3>
                <p>Financial Accounts are a grouping of income and expense items that can be used for tracking or reporting purposes. They’re designed to be flexible and can be used to differentiate between bank accounts, companies, individuals or between personal and business entries.</p>

                <h3>Will I be able to cancel my account if I don’t use Pulse?</h3>
